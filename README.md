# tableau-and-r-for-analytics-projects
A collection of Tableau and R files from LinkedIn Learning Course: Tableau and R for Analytics Projects.

On its own, Tableau is a powerful tool that helps professionals analyze, display, and generally make sense of the data at their fingertips. With the addition of R—a free, open-source language for data science—you can glean even more insights from your data. In this course, learn how to combine the analytical strengths of R with the visualization power of Tableau to analyze and present data more effectively. Instructor Curt Frye demonstrates how to install R and RServe; create a connection between Tableau and R; perform several types of analyses in R, from linear regression to cluster identification; and incorporate those analyses into Tableau visualizations.
